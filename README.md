## Project demo (integrated with its React App)
(Insert demo link here).

## Available endpoints
- (Insert here a list of the endpoints and their description).

## Development
- Clone the repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/VicReyes1/apiWTW.git
```

- Go to the project directory and install dependencies:
```
$ cd apiWTW
$ npm i
```

- To properly run this project, you'll need to authenticate users by using Firebase. We invite you to add an .env file manually in the root directory. Firstly, create your own firebase project and its database. Inside that .env file, add the following line:
```
REACT_APP_ACCESS_KEY = {your access key here, without spaces, formatted in just one line}
```

- To use the required database service, please include the following data inside the same .env file:
```
PORT_serv = 
HOST = 
USER_db = 
PASS = 
NAME_db = 
PORT_db = 
```

- Run the API locally:
```
$ npm run dev
```
